## Developing UI widgets ##

`tools/wbuilder.lua` is your friend, if you need to create new UI widgets. It
sets up a minimal environment to bootstrap KOReader's UI framework to avoid
starting the whole reader. This gives you quick feedback loop while iterating
through your widget changes. It's also a handy tool for debugging widget
issues.

To get a taste of how it works, try running this command at the root of
KOReader's source tree:

```
./kodev wbuilder
```

It will spawn up an emulator window with a grid and simple timer widget for
demonstration.

You can add more `UIManager:show` call at the end of `tools/wbuilder.lua` to
test your new widgets.
