# Before requesting

Please consider that almost all features that you might imagine can be written as standalone plugins and maintained elsewhere.
Some notable examples are https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/anki.koplugin, https://github.com/stelzch/zotero.koplugin or https://github.com/Billiam/hardcoverapp.koplugin

In particular integration with third party services or integrations for particular platforms are better handled elsewhere, where somebody cares ;)

Please **do not open tickets to request integration with particular services** (or bluetooth peripherals or...).
If you have a idea and want to gather feedback please use forum, chat or github discussion (ideas)
If you built something or found something interesting and want to share use forum, chat or github discussion (show&tell)


If you think your request is in the scope of the request we care about (ie: our FM, our reader, our widgets, our supported plugins) please proceed with caution ;)


## Assumptions

We assume you're familiar with the program and spent hours with it, you know where to find documentation and where to ask for support.
We assume your feature request is not a question about the behaviour of a documented feature.
We assume you checked for open and closed tickets. Please **do not open duplicates**, always comment on the original ticket.

# How to request

1. please use english (you can use a translator if you wish)
2. please use a short, descriptive title.
