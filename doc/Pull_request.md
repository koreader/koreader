# Before submiting your work

Please create a feature request or a bug report and tell us the work you'll plan to do before commiting any of your precious time.

Some features (even fixes?) are rejected here for different reasons. It is always better to ask first because in these cases you'll likely save a lot time by crafting a patch for yourself instead of doing a complex UI for users to tweak their settings.
