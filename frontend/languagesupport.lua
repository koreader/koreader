Language-specific handling module.

This module defines a somewhat generic system by which language-specific
plugins can improve KOReader's support for languages that are not close enough
to European languages to "just work".

This was originally designed to improve KoReader's Japanese support through the
Japanese plugin (plugins/japanese.koplugin) but it should be generic enough for
other language plugins to build off this framework. Examples of languages which
may require such a plugin include highly inflected/agglutinative languages
(Japanese and Korean) and languages where spaces are not used as a delimiting
character between words (Japanese and Chinese) and languages that use a
character set where KoReader's dependencies define a "word" as being a single
character.

This module works by providing a mechanism to define a series of callbacks (not
unlike UI Events) which are called during operations where language-specific
knowledge may be necessary (such as during text selection and dictionary lookup
of a text fragment).

Registers a new language-specific plugin with given language_code.

If a plugin using the same language code already exists, the loading is
skipped. The language code is used to prioritise which language plugin should
be called first (if that plugin fails to handle the text, there is no such
plugin, or the document has no language defined then all of the plugins are
called one-by-one until one succeeds).

The follow handlers are defined (if you wish to support the handler create the
corresponding onHandler method):

 - WordSelection (onWordSelection) is called when a highlight is
   first created and can be used to modify the default "word boundary" word
   selection to match user expectations.

   Note that "XPointer" is used here but code written should take it as an
   opaque object and only use the given callbacks since in future this feature
   may work with PDFs and all of the XPointers will instead be PDF equivalents.

   Called with {
        pos0 = [XPointer], pos1 = [XPointer],
        callbacks = {
            -- Equivalent to document:getPrevVisibleChar(pos).
            get_prev_char_pos(pos: XPointer) -> XPointer,
            -- Equivalent to document:getNextVisibleChar(pos).
            get_next_char_pos(pos: XPointer) -> XPointer,
            -- Equivalent to document:getTextFromXPointers(pos0, pos1).
            get_text_in_range(pos0: XPointer, pos1: XPointer) -> string,
        }
   } table as the only argument.

   Must return the new (pos0, pos1) XPointers or nil if the word couldn't be
   expanded.

 - WordLookup (onWordLookup) is called when a dictionary lookup is triggered on
   some text and can be used to adjust the word such that it is in the
   dictionary form and can be found in the dictionary. This is primarily useful
   for languages where StarDict "fuzzy searching" is not usable.

   Called with
     { text = [string] }
   table as the only argument.

   Must return an array of candidate words (in decreasing order of preference)
   which will be looked up or nil if no candidate words could be generated.
   Note that if more than one candidate is found in the dictionary they will
   all be displayed to the user. It is not necessary to include the original
   word in the candidate list -- it will always be given highest priority.
