Registers and shows a widget.

Widgets are registered in a stack, from bottom to top in registration order,
with a few tweaks to handle modals & toasts:
toast widgets are stacked together on top,
then modal widgets are stacked together, and finally come standard widgets.

If you think about how painting will be handled (also bottom to top), this makes perfect sense ;).

For more details about refreshtype, refreshregion & refreshdither see the description of `setDirty`.
If refreshtype is omitted, no refresh will be enqueued at this time.

Mark a window-level widget as dirty, enqueuing a repaint & refresh request for that widget, to be processed on the next UI tick.

The second parameter (refreshtype) can either specify a refreshtype
(optionally in combination with a refreshregion - which is suggested,
and an even more optional refreshdither flag if the content requires dithering);
or a function that returns a refreshtype, refreshregion tuple (or a refreshtype, refreshregion, refreshdither triple),
which will be called *after* painting the widget.
This is an interesting distinction, because a widget's geometry,
usually stored in a field named `dimen`, is (generally) only computed at painting time (e.g., during `paintTo`).
The TL;DR being: if you already know the region, you can pass everything by value directly,
(it'll make for slightly more readable debug logs),
but if the region will only be known after the widget has been painted, pass a function.
Note that, technically, it means that stuff passed by value will be enqueued earlier in the refresh stack.
In practice, since the stack of (both types of) refreshes is optimized into as few actual refresh ioctls as possible,
and that during the next `_repaint` tick (which is when `paintTo` for dirty widgets happens),
this shouldn't change much in the grand scheme of things, but it ought to be noted ;).

See `_repaint` for more details about how the repaint & refresh queues are processed,
and `handleInput` for more details about when those queues are actually drained.
What you should essentially remember is that `setDirty` doesn't actually "do" anything visible on its own.
It doesn't block, and when it returns, nothing new has actually been painted or refreshed.
It just appends stuff to the paint and/or refresh queues.

Here's a quick rundown of what each refreshtype should be used for:

* `full`: high-fidelity flashing refresh (e.g., large images).
          Highest quality, but highest latency.
          Don't abuse if you only want a flash (in this case, prefer `flashui` or `flashpartial`).
* `partial`: medium fidelity refresh (e.g., text on a white background).
             Can be promoted to flashing after `FULL_REFRESH_COUNT` refreshes.
             Don't abuse to avoid spurious flashes.
             In practice, this means this should mostly always be limited to ReaderUI.
* `ui`: medium fidelity refresh (e.g., mixed content).
        Should apply to most UI elements.
        When in doubt, use this.
* `fast`: low fidelity refresh (e.g., monochrome content).
          Should apply to most highlighting effects achieved through inversion.
          Note that if your highlighted element contains text,
          you might want to keep the unhighlight refresh as `"ui"` instead, for crisper text.
          (Or optimize that refresh away entirely, if you can get away with it).
* `flashui`: like `ui`, but flashing.
             Can be used when showing a UI element for the first time, or when closing one, to avoid ghosting.
* `flashpartial`: like `partial`, but flashing (and not counting towards flashing promotions).
                  Can be used when closing an UI element (usually over ReaderUI), to avoid ghosting.
                  You can even drop the region in these cases, to ensure a fullscreen flash.
                  NOTE: On REAGL devices, `flashpartial` will NOT actually flash (by design).
                        As such, even onCloseWidget, you might prefer `flashui` in most instances.

NOTE: You'll notice a trend on UI elements that are usually shown *over* some kind of text (generally ReaderUI)
of using `"ui"` onShow & onUpdate, but `"partial"` onCloseWidget.
This is by design: `"partial"` is what the reader (ReaderUI) uses, as it's tailor-made for pure text
over a white background, so this ensures we resume the usual flow of the reader.
The same dynamic is true for their flashing counterparts, in the rare instances we enforce flashes.
Any kind of `"partial"` refresh *will* count towards a flashing promotion after `FULL_REFRESH_COUNT` refreshes,
so making sure your stuff only applies to the proper region is key to avoiding spurious large black flashes.
That said, depending on your use case, using `"ui"` onCloseWidget can be a perfectly valid decision,
and will ensure never seeing a flash because of that widget.
Remember that the FM uses `"ui"`, so, if said widgets are shown over the FM,
prefer using `"ui"` or `"flashui"` onCloseWidget.

The final parameter (refreshdither) is an optional hint for devices with hardware dithering support that this repaint
could benefit from dithering (e.g., because it contains an image).

As far as the actual lifecycle of a widget goes, the rules are:

* What you `show`, you `close`.
* If you know the dimensions of the widget (or simply of the region you want to refresh), you can pass it directly:
    * to `show` (as `show` calls `setDirty`),
    * to `close` (as `close` will also call `setDirty` on the remaining dirty and visible widgets,
      and will also enqueue a refresh based on that if there are dirty widgets).
* Otherwise, you can use, respectively, a widget's `Show` & `CloseWidget` handlers for that via `setDirty` calls.
  This can also be useful if *child* widgets have specific needs (e.g., flashing, dithering) that they want to inject in the refresh queue.
* Remember that events propagate children first (in array order, starting at the top), and that if *any* event handler returns true,
  the propagation of that specific event for this widget tree stops *immediately*.
  (This generally means that, unless you know what you're doing (e.g., a widget that will *always* be used as a parent),
   you generally *don't* want to return true in `Show` or `CloseWidget` handlers).
* If any widget requires freeing non-Lua resources (e.g., FFI/C), having a `free` method called from its `CloseWidget` handler is ideal:
  this'll ensure that *any* widget including it will be sure that resources are freed when it (or its parent) are closed.
* Note that there *is* a `Close` event, but it has very specific use-cases, generally involving *programmatically* `close`ing a `show`n widget:
    * It is broadcast (e.g., sent to every widget in the window stack; the same rules about propagation apply, but only per *window-level widget*)
      at poweroff/reboot.
    * It can also be used as a keypress handler by @{ui.widget.container.inputcontainer|InputContainer}, generally bound to the Back key.

Please refrain from implementing custom `onClose` methods if that's not their intended purpose ;).

On the subject of widgets and child widgets,
you might have noticed an unspoken convention across the codebase of widgets having a field called `show_parent`.
Since handling this is entirely at the programmer's behest, here's how we usually use it:
Basically, we cascade a field named `show_parent` to every child widget that matter
(e.g., those that serve an UI purpose, as opposed to, say, a container).
This ensures that every subwidget can reference its actual parent
(ideally, all the way to the window-level widget it belongs to, i.e., the one that was passed to `show`, hence the name ;)),
to, among other things, flag the right widget for repaint via `setDirty` (c.f., those pesky debug warnings when that's done wrong ;p) when they want to request a repaint.
This is why you often see stuff doing, when instantiating a new widget, `FancyWidget:new{ show_parent = self.show_parent or self }`;
meaning, if I'm already a subwidget, cascade my parent, otherwise, it means I'm a window-level widget, so cascade myself as that widget's parent ;).

Another convention (that a few things rely on) is naming a (persistent) MovableContainer wrapping a full widget `movable`, accessible as an instance field.
This is useful when it's used for transparency purposes, which, e.g., `setDirty` and @{ui.widget.button|Button} rely on to handle updating translucent widgets properly,
by checking if self.show_parent.movable exists and is currently translucent ;).

When I mentioned passing the *right* widget to `setDirty` earlier, what I meant is that `setDirty` will only actually flag a widget for repaint
*if* that widget is a window-level widget (that is, a widget that was passed to `show` earlier and hasn't been `close`'d yet),
hence the `self.show_parent` convention detailed above to get at the proper widget from within a subwidget ;).
Otherwise, you'll notice in debug mode that a debug guard will shout at you if that contract is broken,
and what happens in practice is the same thing as if an explicit `nil` were passed: no widgets will actually be flagged for repaint,
and only the *refresh* matching the requested region *will* be enqueued.
This is why you'll find a number of valid use-cases for passing a `nil` here, when you *just* want a screen refresh without a repaint :).
The string `"all"` is also accepted in place of a widget, and will do the obvious thing: flag the *full* window stack, bottom to top, for repaint,
while still honoring the refresh region (e.g., this doesn't enforce a full-screen refresh).

This is essentially a cached TimeVal:now(), computed at the top of every iteration of the main UI loop,
(right before checking/running scheduled tasks).
This is mainly useful to compute/schedule stuff in the same time scale as the UI loop (i.e., MONOTONIC),
without having to resort to a syscall.
It should never be significantly stale (i.e., it should be precise enough),
unless you're blocking the UI for a significant amount of time in the same UI tick.

Prefer the appropriate TimeVal method for your needs if you require perfect accuracy
(e.g., when you're actually working on the event loop *itself* (UIManager, Input, GestureDetector)).

This is *NOT* wall clock time (REALTIME).

Ask the EPDC to *block* until our previous refresh ioctl has completed.

This interacts sanely with the existing low-level handling of this in `framebuffer_mxcfb`
(i.e., it doesn't even try to wait for a marker that fb has already waited for, and vice-versa).

Will return immediately if it has already completed.

If the device isn't a Linux + MXCFB device, this is a NOP.

Yield to the EPDC.

This is a dumb workaround for potential races with the EPDC when we request a refresh on a specific region,
and then proceed to *write* to the framebuffer, in the same region, very, very, very soon after that.

This basically just puts ourselves to sleep for a very short amount of time, to let the kernel do its thing in peace.

Used to repaint a specific sub-widget that isn't on the `_window_stack` itself.

Useful to avoid repainting a complex widget when we just want to invert an icon, for instance.
No safety checks on x & y *by design*. I want this to blow up if used wrong.

This is an explicit repaint *now*: it bypasses and ignores the paint queue (unlike `setDirty`).

@param widget a @{ui.widget.widget|widget} object
@int x left origin of widget (in the Screen buffer, e.g., `widget.dimen.x`)

Same idea as `widgetRepaint`, but does a simple `bb:invertRect` on the Screen buffer, without actually going through the widget's `paintTo` method.
