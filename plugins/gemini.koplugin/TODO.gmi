# TODOs for gemini.koplugin

# Easy features
These could be implemented directly, and might be good ideas:
* Log of (hashes of) visited URLs.
* Indication of download progress for large files.
* Gemsub subscription handling.

# Features requiring changes to upstream projects
(or clever workarounds I haven't found)

## Dependent on KOReader
* Addressbar which doesn't try to word-split the URL at punctuation.
* Gemtext supported from start (currently, if the last file was a .gmi file and you restart KOReader, it won't be able to open it, because it tries before the plugin loads). Best would be to add gemtext support to CoolReader directly.
* Way to disable reading statistics for gemini pages without disabling plugin.
* Streaming (might be possible using the progressive rendering architecture?).
* End of document action (Next, or nav menu)

## Dependent on luasec
* Session resumption.
* CA-based verification which checks the hostname.
* Reliable handling of early Titan response.
