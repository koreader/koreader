Installation instructions for Kobo:


Newer installation based on Start Menu
- Install "Start Menu" (http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=233259)
- Extract the koreader folder of the zip into the ".kobo" directory (both KoboRoot.tgz and the koreader.png file are only needed for the older installation based on Filemonitor. See below.). 

Select koreader from the Start Menu to start.


Older installation based on Filemonitor (Please refer to [this post](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=216960).)
- Install "Files Monitor" (http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=218283)
- Put the image included in the zip (called "koreader.png") in the main folder of your kobo and disconnect it from your computer. Open the image on the reader, go back to the home and then, just to be extra-safe, reboot it.
- Extract the remaining content of the zip into the ".kobo" directory (both KoboRoot.tgz and the koreader folder). 

Selecting the KOReader icon in your home, you will be able to launch KOReader. Simple enough, isn't it? Just be sure to process the image properly (follow those steps carefully) if it's the first time you install koreader, if you made a factory reset or if you deleted it in some way, otherwise you could end up launching koreader automatically at every boot, being unable to exit it without a factory reset.

When you update koreader, it should be sufficient to extract the koreader folder, without KoboRoot.tgz - that one is needed to add the launcher.
