Installation instructions for Kobo:
- Install "Files Monitor" (http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=218283)
- Put the image included in the zip (called "koreader.png") in the main folder of your kobo and disconnect it from your computer. Open the image on the reader, go back to the home and then, just to be extra-safe, reboot it.
- Extract the remaining content of the zip in the ".kobo" directory (both KoboRoot.tgz and the koreader folder).

Selecting the KOReader icon in your home, you will be able to launch KOReader. Simple enough, isn't it? Just be sure to process the image properly (follow those steps carefully) if it's the first time you install koreader, if you made a factory reset or if you deleted it in some way, otherwise you could end up launching koreader automatically at every boot, being unable to exit it without a factory reset.

When you update koreader, it should be sufficient to extract the koreader folder, without KoboRoot.tgz - that one is needed to add the launcher.
