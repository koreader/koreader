#### Issue

#### Steps to reproduce

##### `crash.log` (if applicable)
`crash.log` is a file that is automatically created when KOReader crashes. It can
normally be found in the KOReader directory:

* `/mnt/private/koreader` for Cervantes
* `koreader/` directory for Kindle
* `.adds/koreader/` directory for Kobo
* `applications/koreader/` directory for Pocketbook


Android logs are kept in memory. Please go to Help â†’ Bug Report to save these logs to a file.

Please try to include the relevant sections in your issue description.
You can upload the whole `crash.log` file on GitHub by dragging and
dropping it onto this textbox.

If you instead opt to inline it, please do so behind a spoiler tag:
<details>
  <summary>crash.log</summary>

```
<Paste crash.log content here>
```
