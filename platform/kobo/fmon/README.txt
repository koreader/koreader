Installation instructions for Kobo:


Main installation method based on Start Menu:
- Install "Start Menu" (https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=293804)
- Extract the koreader folder of the zip into the ".adds" directory (the koreader.png file are only needed for the alternate installation methods based on fmon. See below.).

Select koreader from the Start Menu to start.

----

Alternate installation method based on fmon:
- Put the image included in the zip (called "koreader.png") in an "icons" folder created in the main folder of your Kobo and disconnect it from your computer. Add the icon to a collection, set the view to List View and open the icon, then restart your device.
- Install "fmon" (https://github.com/baskerville/fmon).
- Extract the remaining content of the zip into the ".adds" directory (the koreader folder).

Selecting the KOReader icon in your home, you will be able to launch KOReader. Simple enough, isn't it? Just be sure to process the image properly (follow those steps carefully) if it's the first time you install koreader, after a factory reset or if you deleted it in some way, in order to make sure KOReader starts properly.

When you update koreader manually, it should be sufficient to simply extract the koreader folder.

NOTE: Using the legacy version of fmon (http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=218283) is *STRONGLY* discouraged.
NOTEÂ²: If you like the concept, and want to check out something a bit more flexible/complex, check out KFMon (https://github.com/NiLuJe/kfmon).
