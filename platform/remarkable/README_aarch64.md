# General

When connected to Wi-Fi you can find the IP address and root password for your
reMarkable in Settings -> About, then scroll down the GPLv3 compliance on the
right (finger drag scroll, not the page forward/back buttons). This should also
work for the USB network you get if you connect the reMarkable to your computer
with a USB cable.

# Install & Launching
